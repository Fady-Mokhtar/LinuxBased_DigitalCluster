# Instructions for Feature Branch Workflow

1. **Feature Branch Creation**: Create a main feature branch from the main codebase (e.g., `master` or `main` branch). For example, if we're working on a feature called "Authentication" for an e-commerce website, you can create the feature branch by executing:
   
   - *Example*: Create a branch named `feature/authentication`.

2. **Sub-Branches Creation**: Each developer working on the feature creates their own sub-branch from the main feature branch. These sub-branches should have a naming convention that reflects the feature or task being worked on. For example, if we have two tasks within the "Authentication" feature - "User Login" and "User Registration", you can create sub-branches for each task:
   
   - *Example*: For the "User Login" task, create a branch named `feature/authentication/user-login`.
   
   - *Example*: For the "User Registration" task, create a branch named `feature/authentication/user-registration`.

3. **Individual Work**: Developers work independently on their respective sub-branches, implementing the specific tasks or features assigned to them.

4. **Collaboration and Integration**: Once a developer completes their work on their sub-branch, they create a pull request to merge their changes into the main feature branch. Other developers can review and provide feedback on the changes as needed.

5. **Merge into Feature Branch**: After the changes are reviewed and approved, they are merged into the main feature branch.
