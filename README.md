# Motor ECU Feature Development Guide

Welcome to the Motor ECU feature development guide. This document provides comprehensive instructions for developers on how to effectively contribute to the development of features within the Motor ECU feature branch, following established best practices and workflows.

## Getting Started

To commence your work on Motor ECU features, adhere to the following steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine to establish a local working environment.

2. **Create Sub-Branch**: For each task you're assigned, create a dedicated sub-branch from the main feature branch (`Feature/Motor_ECU`).

3. **Commence Work**: Initiate your task or feature development within the designated sub-branch, ensuring all modifications to the Motor ECU setup are encapsulated within this branch.

4. **Commit Changes**: As you progress with your task or feature development, commit your changes regularly to ensure a granular record of your work.

5. **Push Changes**: Upon completing your work on the sub-branch, push your commits to the remote repository to synchronize your changes.

## Collaboration and Integration

Following the completion of task or feature development, adhere to the following steps to seamlessly integrate your changes into the main project:

1. **Create Pull Request**: Initiate a pull request to merge your task or feature sub-branch into the main feature branch (`Feature/Motor_ECU`), encompassing all modifications made during development.

2. **Review and Merge**: Facilitate a comprehensive review process, soliciting feedback from team members. Upon approval, your changes will be merged into the main project, facilitating integration of the Motor ECU feature.

## Additional Notes

- Effective communication and collaboration among team members are paramount to ensuring smooth project development.
- In the event of queries or issues, do not hesitate to seek assistance from fellow team members or project leads.

We appreciate your dedication to the development of the Motor ECU feature and look forward to your valuable contributions.

Happy coding!
